Bastion is a straight forward easy-level machine on HacktheBox that starts with enumerating a .vhd backup file that we mounted from an anonymous SMB share, from there we dump the User hash using Impacket's SecretsDump. To privesc, we struggle running automated tools and running into issues with UAC until we discover that one of the applications downloaded on the machine stores an encrypted administrator password, which we can use to SSH into the box and get a System shell.

### Enumeration

Nmap tells us that this is a Windows server with SSH open, this information combined with the name "Bastion" leads us to believe that we will be attacking some type of jumpbox. Let's check out SMB.

![smb](/assets/img/bastion/smb.png)

Listing shares with the -L option, we see a backups folder, which is certainly not standard, let's mount the entire drive to our machine so we can enumerate it further.

![mount](/assets/img/bastion/mount.png)

Looking around the mounted files, we can find the User name "L4mpje", as well as 2 .vhd backup files that we can mount and enumerate further. We run this command (as root) in order to see it's contents.

`guestmount --add 9b9cfbc4-369e-11e9-a17c-806e6f6e6963.vhd --inspector --ro -v /mnt/vhd/`

If we do this with both vhd files, we can see that one of them represents the boot partition, and the other is the actual contents on the drive. Let's ignore the boot partition and continue enumeration.

![enum](/assets/img/bastion/enum.png)

We can see that we are in the C:\ directory of a windows machine. (read only)

![sam](/assets/img/bastion/sam.png)

The SAM and SYSTEM are particularly juicy, as they contain hashes for users on the box, and are typically only readable by the administrator account, however since we're viewing a backup, we can use Impackets-Secretsdump to dump these hashes locally.

![secrets](/assets/img/bastion/secretsdump.png)

We can crack these hashes with John or Hashcat to return the password.

### Foothold

Seems like the Administrator password doesn't want to be cracked, but we got L4mpje's password nonetheless. Let's SSH into the box.

![ssh](/assets/img/bastion/ssh.png)

From here we can try running the automated tools that we usually do, like winPEAS, Sherlock.ps1, PowerUp.ps1, but they'll get permission denied due to the UAC on the box (user access control). Looking around for recently installed programs, we see something in the Program Files (x86) folder.

![mremote](/assets/img/bastion/mremote.png)

With some google magic, we find out that this application stores encrypted credentials in the %APPDATA%mRemoteNG folder in a file named confCons.xml, and this can sometimes be the admin password. Let's check it out with 
`type %appdata%\mRemoteNG\confcons.xml`

![type](/assets/img/bastion/type.png)

We can grab the encrypted password and use a tool called mRemoteNG-Decrypt to decrypt the string.

![adminpass](/assets/img/bastion/adminpass.png)

using this password, we can ssh into the box as administrator.
