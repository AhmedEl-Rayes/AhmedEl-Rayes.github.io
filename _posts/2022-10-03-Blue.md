Blue is an easy level Windows machine on Hack the Box featuring the notorious CVE-2017-0143, which was used in the "WannaCry" ransomware attacks. Due to the nature of this vulnerability, it's a pretty straight forward route from boot to root. That being said, this vulnerability will always have a historical significance as it is theorized to have been developed by the NSA, and it's unintended release led to massive waves of ransomware attacks globally, or so the story goes.

### Enumeration

Anyways, we run an NMAP on the target which shows us:

```bash

Our trusty nmap scripts found the OS: Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 (Windows 7 Professional 6.1), and a bunch of other information about SMB on the machine. Running another nmap, this time specifying to use the vuln scripts on port 445:


```bash

We can see that this version of SMB is vulnerable to CVE-2017-0143, which allows an unauthenticated user remote code execution. This vulnerability is more popularly known as EternalBlue (ms17-010), and you will see now why it is classified as a high severity vulnerability.

Using msfconsole, we search "ms17-010" and select a payload.

![hosts](/assets/img/blue/hosts.png)

Once we've set the listener and remote host ip addresses, we're ready to go.

In just a few commands, and with 0 technical prowess, we've gone from unauthenticated user to system level access on the machine.
